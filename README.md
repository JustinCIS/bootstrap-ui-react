# Front-End Developer Challenge and Questions
We realize there are often multiple solutions or answers to the same questions and to the challenge in particular. We do not necessarily have “right or wrong” in mind, we are simply looking to learn a bit about you, and your approach to development. 


## Questions:

### What front-end component libraries or frameworks have you used besides bootstrap?
React Material UI, React Native Material UI, PrimeReact, Angular Material, PrimeNG, etc.

### What tools would you implement to enforce code quality rules and standards? 
ESLint, Prettier, Flow

### What HTML templating languages or engines have you used?
Underscore, Pug, Lodash

### Which code related blogs or sites do you read regularly?
PluralSight, Academind, Coursetro, SitePoint, Stack Overflow, HackerNoon, Codeburst.io, /r/Javascript, etc. 

### In Sass, what is the significance of using an underscore at the beginning of a sass file name?
Denotes the usage of a partial class, which is used for imports/modularity.

### Name a few (npm) node modules that you think are most useful?
Express, Redux, Chalk, Request, Moment, Axios, Mongoose, JSON-Server, etc. 

### Given the option to choose Angular, React or Vue.js for a new project which would you choose and why? What type of requirements might affect your decision to use one over the other?
This is a fairly loaded question, but given my lack of experience in Vue.js, I can only speak from an Angular vs React position (albeit I wouldn’t mind picking up Vue.js given how it apparently leverages the best of both Angular and React worlds.  I would have to consider what our workforce is most comfortable with – and would listen to any/all arguments pining for it), but given the strength of both the Angular and React communities/founding bodies (Google and Facebook respectively), I’d feel comfortable picking between the two.
I would say the main requirements that would impact my decision to use one technology over the other would be performance, and scalability.  As a Framework, sometimes Angular can be convoluted and includes toolsets that you may not necessarily need (which can of course impact performance), whereas with React, you have to choose your toolsets since its focus is primarily on the view.  It does generally perform better than Angular as a result of its Virtual DOM, however, React typically takes more time to bootstrap and get going since you have to take the time to select your accompanying toolsets.  From a scalability standpoint, you would have to consider testability and whether or not mobile will be an option down the road.  Angular’s path to mobile is generally split between two products - Ionic and NativeScript, whereas React is a bit more clear cut with React Native.  At the end of the day, many items can be considered, but some would argue that “feel” is the most compelling case to be made when picking between Javascript Frameworks.

### If you were referred to an unfamiliar node project repo, what file or files would you first look to, to determine the commands to run, build and test the project?
Package.json, README.md

### What is the benefit of using the HTML ‘nav’ element vs. a div with the class of .nav?
The Nav tag provides a semantic block element that informs browsers and developers that the area is reserved for Navigationelements/links. 

### What code related framework, library or language do you want to learn next?
I’d like to keep pushing the envelope in both Angular, React and Node, but other than that, I’d like to add Vue to the list at some point.  Electron, Flutter and Cycle.js have also peeked my interest as well.
